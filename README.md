# Product Landing Page


It's a simple webpage that contains several products,in the left side of the webpage different cards are present where product nam and prices are shown whereas on the right side product specification is given properly along with the customer review.



Build up the skeleton of this webpage using HTML , firstly divide the page into two portions in proper proportions. Then build the internal structures of the two portions seperately. The left container is wide with respect to the right container.

Using CSS I have implemented all the styles inside the webpage and in some cases BOOTSTRAP is also used. The icon is created using favicon.

Also GSAP is used here to create a fancy animation throughout the webpage , GSAP is a powerful library of JAVASCRIPT mainly to use several animation in the webpages.
